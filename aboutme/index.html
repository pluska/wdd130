    <h2>Andres Pluska</h2>
    <p>
      Hello everyone, I am from Venezuela, but I am currently living in Peru, I
      am 28 years old. I am married and have two daughters. The older of them is
      pure nuclear energy, while the other one is usually quiet and still.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love programming and technology, I found this passion since I was 14
      years old on a notepad writing "Hello World" in JavaScript. Currently I'm
      a full-stack developer, but my forte is backend since I'm bad at going
      deep into design and making everything look pretty. My goal is to pursue a
      degree in Applied Technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am usually at home, since I work virtually, study virtually and do
      almost all my activities virtually. That doesn't mean I don't enjoy going
      out to eat or enjoying a walk to a new place. I like to go to the gym, I
      consider that physical wellness is very important, as well as spiritual
      wellness.
