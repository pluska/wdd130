        <h2>FullStack Developer – SweatWorks LLC</h2>
        <p>I have been developing software for the wellness sector for different companies since August 2021 up to the present time. The development is carried out in teams working with agile methodologies such as Scrum or Kanban, developing content management systems or CMS, API for different services and programs for tracking exercises and routines.</p>
        <p>These programs have been developed mainly with React.js and Node.js, using also libraries or frameworks such as: Redux, Express.js, Strapi, Prisma, Sequelize, Sass, Webpack and Tailwind. MySQL and PostgreSQL databases, and AWS and Google Cloud Platform frameworks. In some programs TypeScript has been implemented to better define variables and keep the code more consistent.</p>
        <p>A second task that I perform is the management of employee access, such as the creation and deactivation of their accounts when they enter the company or when they leave, as well as solving any incident in the different platforms. Here I developed a system for managing access and to determine the systems associated with the accounts without having to keep a manual record of all this, thus optimizing my work.</p>

      <h2>Fullstack Developer – JORZCORP</h2>
      <p>This has been a project of creation of events and races or sports activities, which has gone through two stages, the first where I developed several improvements to the MeetingField platform, which needed to fix bugs, for sending tickets, or purchase notifications, checking transfers and approval of these. Deactivation of past events, etc.</p>
      <p>This first stage was developed in PHP only, along with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery and a MySQL database. It lasted six months from May 2022 to November 2022.</p>
      <p>Currently the platform is in a second stage where it had a restructuring of the design and identity, now known as EvenTiquets. This stage began in December 2022 and I have been developing it from the beginning with a CMS, then the basic content pages and authentication system, event creation systems, shopping cart tickets and check in, ticket verification system and transfer, QR scanning, PDF generation, among others. The platform is currently operational and is expected to be launched in April 2023.</p>
      <p>This stage also migrated to Laravel, to optimize security, order and to facilitate the construction of the site, along with the use of Sass, JQuery, Eloquent, Blade, MySQL. In addition to using wrappers like Simple-QRcode, dompdf and Snappy.</p>
