    <h2>May name is Andres Pluska</h2>
    <p>My name is Andres Pluska, and since I was 14 years old, I have this passion for knowing how video games work, the devices we use everyday something as simple as a calculator or even something as complex as a computer (well at least it was complex for me at that age). Now that I have understood some of those things, I see it so harmonious and I feel attracted to programming, I love everything that is possible to create by just typing commands, it is something that makes me feel like a superhero. Besides, the logic of programming seems to me so simple and so important, that I even wonder why we as people can't function in the same way.</p>
    <p>But leaving aside the reason why I am a programmer, I share how I started this path, as I said since I was 14 years old I started to develop and study as a hobby on my computer JavaScript, and from there at 17 years old I started studying systems engineering, where for various circumstances I could only complete one year of my career and then postpone my university studies until 26, but during that time I was studying various courses, where I learned the basics of web programming, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, then I took a step forward in my career by learning PHP and for a while I was satisfied with this until I saw how much I could do with a framework, so I started to study Laravel and I thought that was enough until I met React and I became fond of JavaScript again, again I took many courses to catch up with the advances in JavaScript, and although I explored Vue and Angular also as probable options for programming, I preferred to continue specializing in React and attach the backend side with Node, where I felt very comfortable because I already had a broad knowledge of the backend side by PHP. Currently I continue learning React, Node and Laravel, with plans to expand to the mobile side with React Native. In addition to continuing my studies at university with more technical stuff and also Python. Most of my knowledge I have acquired by self-learning, using platforms like udemy and platzi, mostly the latter and watching some videos on Youtube.</p>
    <p>I started my professional career as a freelancer, offering my services in Workana, Fiveer and Upwork where I worked in small projects as frontend and then when I moved to Peru, I got work with other small companies that first hired me as frontend and then I could be full stack (when I learned PHP).</p>
    <p>While I'm not programming, I dedicate myself to improve my English, I consider it has been an important part of my career and I don't like to leave it aside, I also read self-help books, because they inspire me and motivate me to keep going. In addition, with my last job I have adopted an ideology of wellness that drives me to maintain a balance in my intellectual, spiritual and physical part, so I also dedicate my time to go to the gym.</p>
