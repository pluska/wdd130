        Visitors to my web portfolio will first see the different programming languages I know: “React - Node - Laravel” followed by the work experience of those programming languages:
      </p>
      <p>
        FullStack Developer – SweatWorks LLC: I have been developing software for the wellness sector for different companies since August 2021 up to the present time. The development is carried out in teams working with agile methodologies such as Scrum or Kanban, developing content management systems or CMS, API for different services and programs for tracking exercises and routines.
      </p>
      <p>
        These programs have been developed mainly with React.js and Node.js, using also libraries or frameworks such as: Redux, Express.js, Strapi, Prisma, Sequelize, Sass, Webpack and Tailwind. MySQL and PostgreSQL databases, and AWS and Google Cloud Platform frameworks. In some programs TypeScript has been implemented to better define variables and keep the code more consistent.
      </p>
      <p>
        A second task that I perform is the management of employee access, such as the creation and deactivation of their accounts when they enter the company or when they leave, as well as solving any incident in the different platforms. Here I developed a system for managing access and to determine the systems associated with the accounts without having to keep a manual record of all this, thus optimizing my work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fullstack Developer – JORZCORP: This has been a project of creation of events and races or sports activities, which has gone through two stages, the first where I developed several improvements to the MeetingField platform, which needed to fix bugs, for sending tickets, or purchase notifications, checking transfers and approval of these. Deactivation of past events, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        This first stage was developed in PHP only, along with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery and a MySQL database. It lasted six months from May 2022 to November 2022.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently the platform is in a second stage where it had a restructuring of the design and identity, now known as EvenTiquets. This stage began in December 2022 and I have been developing it from the beginning with a CMS, then the basic content pages and authentication system, event creation systems, shopping cart tickets and check in, ticket verification system and transfer, QR scanning, PDF generation, among others. The platform is currently operational and is expected to be launched in April 2023.
      </p>
      <p>
        This stage also migrated to Laravel, to optimize security, order and to facilitate the construction of the site, along with the use of Sass, JQuery, Eloquent, Blade, MySQL. In addition to using wrappers like Simple-QRcode, dompdf and Snappy.
      </p>
      <p>
        FullStack Developer – AgroCredit Corporation SAC (AgroInvesting and Altera.lat): I have developed and carried out the maintenance of the AgroInvesting.lat and altera.lat websites, both platforms in the financial sector during one year (September 2020 – September 2021. Developing financial calculators, loan approval filters and implementing various improvements for the acquisition of data from both the lender and investors, such as geolocation, and evaluation of goods and assets.
      </p>
      <p>
        The systems have been mainly based on Laravel, along with Sass for style management, Eloquent as ORM, JQuery, Blade templates, MySQL for the database, AWS EC2 for system hosting.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will add a link to a Laravel project, a React project and a Node project which are the main languages I know from my GitHub Account.

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        My name is Andres Pluska, and since I was 14 years old, I have this passion for knowing how video games work, the devices we use everyday something as simple as a calculator or even something as complex as a computer (well at least it was complex for me at that age). Now that I have understood some of those things, I see it so harmonious and I feel attracted to programming, I love everything that is possible to create by just typing commands, it is something that makes me feel like a superhero. Besides, the logic of programming seems to me so simple and so important, that I even wonder why we as people can't function in the same way.
      </p>
      <p>
        But leaving aside the reason why I am a programmer, I share how I started this path, as I said since I was 14 years old I started to develop and study as a hobby on my computer JavaScript, and from there at 17 years old I started studying systems engineering, where for various circumstances I could only complete one year of my career and then postpone my university studies until 26, but during that time I was studying various courses, where I learned the basics of web programming, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, then I took a step forward in my career by learning PHP and for a while I was satisfied with this until I saw how much I could do with a framework, so I started to study Laravel and I thought that was enough until I met React and I became fond of JavaScript again, again I took many courses to catch up with the advances in JavaScript, and although I explored Vue and Angular also as probable options for programming, I preferred to continue specializing in React and attach the backend side with Node, where I felt very comfortable because I already had a broad knowledge of the backend side by PHP. Currently I continue learning React, Node and Laravel, with plans to expand to the mobile side with React Native. In addition to continuing my studies at university with more technical stuff and also Python. Most of my knowledge I have acquired by self-learning, using platforms like udemy and platzi, mostly the latter and watching some videos on Youtube.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started my professional career as a freelancer, offering my services in Workana, Fiveer and Upwork where I worked in small projects as frontend and then when I moved to Peru, I got work with other small companies that first hired me as frontend and then I could be full stack (when I learned PHP).
      </p>
        <p>
        While I'm not programming, I dedicate myself to improve my English, I consider it has been an important part of my career and I don't like to leave it aside, I also read self-help books, because they inspire me and motivate me to keep going. In addition, with my last job I have adopted an ideology of wellness that drives me to maintain a balance in my intellectual, spiritual and physical part, so I also dedicate my time to go to the gym.

      </ul>
      <h3>Contact Me</h3>
      <p>
        On the contact page, below the title I will place a small message that says: "Need help solving a problem? Fill out the contact form and I'll help you find a solution. Or maybe you want to team up with me on a project, I'd love to know what idea you have. Also don't shy away from sending me a work proposal, maybe we'll coworkers - whatever your message is, I look forward to hearing from you!"
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, I will add a form where I will ask for the person's name, email, the company he/she works for (this field will be optional), the reason why he/she is contacting me, which will be a select with the options: "to hire me for your company", "so I can fix a problem with your website", "you want to start a project together with me" or "you need a tutor". Finally, a field where to write a message, where of course leave your complete proposal. Once I have completed and submitted the form a message will appear saying "Thank you for writing me, I will contact you as soon as possible".
      </p>
      <p>
        Next to the contact form I will add my social networks that I normally use for work stuff, that is Twitter, LinkedIn and GitHub, these links will be created with the respective texts and possibly look for an icon to place it on the side.
